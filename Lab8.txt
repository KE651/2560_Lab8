Property... was accessed during render but is not defined on instance: this means that something that is being called, such as a variable, is not defined within the scope of the Vue script.  If it is ignored, the program will likely not work as expected.  To fix it, check variable definitions and make sure they are defined.  This error can be caused by a missing “return” statement in the data block, by an undefined variable, or by syntax errors that cause the Vue script to not execute properly (spelling errors in variable names or reserved words, missing or excess commas, brackets or parenthesis, missing reserved words or tags).
